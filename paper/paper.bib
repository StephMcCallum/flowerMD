Atomistic melt properties are not used in the parametrization. We show that the coarse-grained polystyrene model not only predicts melt properties, including the melt packing and the density between 400 and 520 K, in satisfactory agreement with the atomistic model, but also reproduces the local chain conformations of atactic as well as stereoregular polystyrene. The model takes into account and reproduces correlations between neighboring bonded degrees of freedom and therefore reproduces the conformations of detailed atomistic chains in the melt on all length scales. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {We present a versatile systematic two-bead-per-monomer coarse-grain modeling strategy for simulating the thermomechanical behavior of methacrylate polymers at length and time scales far exceeding atomistic simulations. We establish generic bonded interaction parameters via Boltzmann inversion of probability distributions obtained from the common coarse-grain bead center locations of five different methacrylate polymers. Distinguishing features of each monomer side-chain group are captured using Lennard-Jones nonbonded potentials with parameters specified to match the density and glass-transition temperature values obtained from all-atomistic simulations. The developed force field is validated using Flory-Fox scaling relationships, self-diffusion coefficients of monomers, and modulus of elasticity for p(MMA). Our approach establishes a transferable, efficient, and accurate scale-bridging strategy for investigating the thermomechanics of copolymers, polymer blends, and nanocomposites. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {In this work, an extension is proposed to the standard iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) method used to derive coarse-grained potentials. It is shown that the inclusion of target data from multiple states yields a less state-dependent potential, and is thus better suited to simulate systems over a range of thermodynamic states than the standard IBI method. The inclusion of target data from multiple states forces the algorithm to sample regions of potential phase space that match the radial distribution function at multiple state points, thus producing a derived potential that is more representative of the underlying interactions. It is shown that the algorithm is able to converge to the true potential for a system where the underlying potential is known. It is also shown that potentials derived via the proposed method better predict the behavior of n-alkane chains than those derived via the standard IBI method. Additionally, through the examination of alkane monolayers, it is shown that the relative weight given to each state in the fitting procedure can impact bulk system properties, allowing the potentials to be further tuned in order to match the properties of reference atomistic and/or experimental systems.},

	abstract = {A coarse-grained water model is developed using multistate iterative Boltzmann inversion. Following previous work, the k-means algorithm is used to dynamically map multiple water molecules to a single coarse-grained bead, allowing the use of structure-based coarse-graining methods. The model is derived to match the bulk and interfacial properties of liquid water and improves upon previous work that used single state iterative Boltzmann inversion. The model accurately reproduces the density and structural correlations of water at 305 K and 1.0 atm, stability of a liquid droplet at 305 K, and shows little tendency to crystallize at physiological conditions. This work also illustrates several advantages of using multistate iterative Boltzmann inversion for deriving generally applicable coarse-grained forcefields.},

	abstract = {Ceramide (CER)-based biological membranes are used both experimentally and in simulations as simplified model systems of the skin barrier. Molecular dynamics studies have generally focused on simulating preassembled structures using atomistically detailed models of CERs, which limit the system sizes and time scales that can practically be probed, rendering them ineffective for studying particular phenomena, including self-assembly into bilayer and lamellar superstructures. Here, we report on the development of a coarse-grained (CG) model for CER NS, the most abundant CER in human stratum corneum. Multistate iterative Boltzmann inversion is used to derive the intermolecular pair potentials, resulting in a force field that is applicable over a range of state points and suitable for studying ceramide self-assembly. The chosen CG mapping, which includes explicit interaction sites for hydroxyl groups, captures the directional nature of hydrogen bonding and allows for accurate predictions of several key structural properties of CER NS bilayers. Simulated wetting experiments allow the hydrophobicity of CG beads to be accurately tuned to match atomistic wetting behavior, which affects the whole system, since inaccurate hydrophobic character is found to unphysically alter the lipid packing in hydrated lamellar states. We find that CER NS can self-assemble into multilamellar structures, enabling the study of lipid systems more representative of the multilamellar lipid structures present in the skin barrier. The coarse-grained force field derived herein represents an important step in using molecular dynamics to study the human skin barrier, which gives a resolution not available through experiment alone.},

	abstract = {The lipid matrix of the stratum corneum (SC) layer of skin is essential for human survival; it acts as a barrier to prevent rapid dehydration while keeping potentially hazardous material outside the body. While the composition of the SC lipid matrix is known, the molecular-level details of its organization are difficult to infer experimentally, hindering the discovery of structure-property relationships. To this end, molecular dynamics simulations, which give molecular-level resolution, have begun to play an increasingly important role in understanding these relationships. However, most simulation studies of SC lipids have focused on preassembled bilayer configurations, which, owing to the slow dynamics of the lipids, may influence the final structure and hence the calculated properties. Self-assembled structures would avoid this dependence on the initial configuration, however, the size and length scales involved make self-assembly impractical to study with atomistic models. Here, we report on the development of coarse-grained models of SC lipids designed to study self-assembly. Building on previous work, we present the interactions between the headgroups of ceramide and free fatty acid developed using the multistate iterative Boltzmann inversion method. Validation of the new interactions is performed with simulations of preassembled bilayers and good agreement between the atomistic and coarse-grained models is found for structural properties. The self-assembly of mixtures of ceramide and free fatty acid is investigated and both bilayer and multilayer structures are found to form. This work therefore represents a necessary step in studying SC lipid systems on multiple time and length scales.},

abstract = {The predictive capabilities of computational materials science today derive from overlapping advances in simulation tools, modeling techniques, and best practices. We outline this ecosystem of molecular simulations by explaining how important contributions in each of these areas have fed into each other. The combined output of these tools, techniques, and practices is the ability for researchers to advance understanding by efficiently combining simple models with powerful software. As specific examples, we show how the prediction of organic photovoltaic morphologies have improved by orders of magnitude over the last decade, and how the processing of reacting epoxy thermosets can now be investigated with million-particle models. We discuss these two materials systems and the training of materials simulators through the lens of cognitive load theory. For students, the broad view of ecosystem components should facilitate understanding how the key parts relate to each other first, followed by targeted exploration. In this way, the paper is organized in loose analogy to a coarse-grained model: The main components provide basic framing and accelerated sampling from which deeper research is better contextualized. For mentors, this paper is organized to provide a snapshot in time of the current simulation ecosystem and an on-ramp for simulation experts into the literature on pedagogical practice.}
